# NodeJS E-Commerce

## Description
I developed this Node.js e-commerce website in March 2022 as a practice project after completing a Node.js course. As this was my first attempt at creating a Node.js website independently, it presented a significant challenge for me. The website serves as a beginner-level e-commerce platform built using Express.js and Pug. During the development process, I primarily focused on implementing functionalities rather than design or product selection, as my main objective was to practice and solidify my Node.js skills.

`Important note`: During the development of this website, I encountered a unique experience. After completing a Node.js and Express.js course, I realized that the course was incomplete, leaving me with gaps in my understanding. Despite the challenges, I started working on this website immediately. I discovered that I lacked knowledge in crucial areas, such as updating objects in MongoDB. I extensively researched and read documentation to find answers, but some questions remained unanswered. To overcome this, I had to devise my own solutions and approaches to building the website. Finally, I managed to complete the website, as you can see now.
